# Hey!

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services in The Hague, Netherlands.

* I write software that is hosted on [GitHub.](https://github.com/adijo) 

* On my [blog,](http://adijo.github.io/blog/) I primarily write about programming and maths problems that I have worked on. I have started doing this from January 2016. This page also has some of my study notes. 

* You can read about my [projects](http://adijo.github.io/projects/), [professional](http://adijo.github.io/professional/) and [research](http://adijo.github.io/research/) experience.

* I did some algorithmic programming competitions
  * [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/adijo) highest rank: Top 1% in India, 433 out of 39,528 in long competitions.
  * [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/users/adijo/) highest rank: Top 10% Wordwide.

* My highest rank on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityanjoshi) is 446 out of 389,842 people. 
* I have started solving problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): ![PE stats](https://projecteuler.net/profile/rosetta.png "")
  
* I have solved 54 problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/users/adijo/) in the field of bioinformatics.

* I enjoy answering questions on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3375198/adijo), [Mathematics Stackexchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/113573/adijo) and [Quora.](https://www.quora.com/Aditya-N-Joshi) Some of my favourite answers:

  
  * [Calculating Average Time based on Success Probability](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/787923/113573)


  * [Question about Coupon Collector's problem](http://qr.ae/RgO7tL)

  * [How do you implement a Hash Table in Python?](http://qr.ae/RgO7vw)

  * [What is the highest power of 2 that evenly divides $3^{1024} - 1$](http://qr.ae/RgO7yp)

  * [How does one obtain the recursive formula for the rod cutting problem?](http://qr.ae/RgO7y5)

  * [What is the binomial distribution?](http://qr.ae/RgO7ob)

  * [What is the best algorithm for finding shortest path with some limitations?](http://qr.ae/RgO75P)

  * [Let's say I was playing a game. In the game, I have a 1 in 10 chance of winning, then 1 in 100, then 1 in 1000, and on and on. I have an infinite number of tries. What are the chances that I eventually win?](http://qr.ae/RgO7w4)
