title: Rosalind - Constructing a De Bruin Graph
---

### Analysis

This was a rather straightforward implementation [problem.](http://rosalind.info/problems/dbru/) The problem invovled the construction of a [De Bruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph) graph which a directed graph that has several biological applications. I am feeling pretty lazy so I will not explain my (rather poorly written) code, but here is a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ecmECK7lw) that explains how to construct such a graph.
