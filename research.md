  I worked along with <a href = "http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~farhat/">Dr. Farhat Habib</a> on various research projects in Computational Biology.

### Micro RNA Target Prediction
A  micro  RNA  molecule  is  a  21-25  nucleotide  long  non-coding  strand  that  isinvolved in post-transcriptional gene regulation activities.
We used a Stochastic pairwise alignment algorithm to predict potential binding sites.

### Genotype Phenotype Correlation Tool
We present GePhCorT (Genotype Phenotype Correlation Tool), an algorithm that relies on finding the optimal states of the characters over a phylogeny, and then using randomization testing to assess the significance of the correlation between the genotype and phenotype. I worked on parallelizing the code using Redis and Python's 
`multiprocessing` modules. Code is on [GitHub.](https://github.com/Farhat/gephcort)

### Early Metazoan Repeats Database
In progress.
